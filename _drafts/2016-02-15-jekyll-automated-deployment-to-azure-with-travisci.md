Welcome to the continuing series on using Jekyll.  In this tutorial we are going to setup Travis CI to automatically build your Jekyll site and then deploy it to an Azure Web App.

Even though I host my blog on Github Pages there have been several times where I wanted to see what theme changes or a new post would look like without having to publish the change to my domain.

As well I have written many of my blog post on my phone but have had to wait until I was at a computer to make sure the post liked good before publishing it.

* add html proffer
* reading log  files
