As a public speaker one of the most important things for me is getting feedback from attendees.  The feedback helps me get better as a presenter as well as figuring out what is working in a talk and what is not. 

When I started speaking I tried several different speaker feedback sites but the number of people that actually have feedback was extremely low (like 1 out of a hundred).  It wasn't until one of the attendees gave me feedback in person and told that they wanted to leave feedback but just didn't want to register for another online account.  

I had been talking with other speakers about how they get feedback and all of them seemed to have the same issue of low response rate. 

Then I meet ???? from [Twilio ](http:/twillio.com) and he mentioned a totally different way that they asked for talk feedback.  At Twilio they used something called Net Promoter Score (NPS).   

NPS ask the user to rate something on a scale of 1 to 10.   10 meaning, I would bring my best friend to see the talk and 1 being, please never give this talk again.  

NPS seems easy enough but you still need some way to get the feedback.
