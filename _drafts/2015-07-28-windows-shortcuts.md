Below are some general productivity tips for Windows shortcuts that I use.  These are all built directly into Windows.


##Moving Program between half screen, full screen and monitors

* Move program to half screen on the left side: Windows Key + Left Arrow
* Move Program to half screen on the right side: Windows Key + Right Arrow
* Move to next monitor in same position: Add Shift key to commands

* Minimze Program: Windows Key + Down Arrow
* Maximize Program: Windows Key + Up Arrow

##Start Program as Administrator

Windows 8: 

1. Windows Key
1. Start typing program name to bring up search bar
1. Find the program that you want to open as admin in the results list
1. Either Ctrl + Shift + Left Mouse Click or Ctrl + Shift + Enter
1. When prompted to open as adminstrative, click the yes button

##Quickly Opening up Visual Studio Solutions

?????

Example: 

1. Pin Visual Studio icon to taskbar
1. Open a Visual Studio Solution
1. Right-click on Visual Studio icon in taskbar
1. Find the project that you just opened and click the pin icon next to it
1. Now instead of having to open Visual Studio and navigating to the solution file, you can right-click on the Visual Studio icon and select the solution from the pinned item.

 ##Quickly Opening Task Manager
 
 You can pull up the task manager by right-click on the taskbar and under the start menu by typing Task manager.  However, there is a Windows shortcut for this as well, Ctrl+Shift+Esc
 
 ##Quickly Navigating in Windows Explorer
 
 Windows explorer has the favorites links section that you can drag folder onto.  This is a great place to put common used folder and the folders for current solutions that you are working on.  Adding or Removing folders does not have any affect on the actual folder, it only affects the shortcut.
