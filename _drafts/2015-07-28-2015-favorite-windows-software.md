Here is my list of favorite windows software that I install on all of my development machines. 

* [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org) - Install Windows software the easy way.  Take the guess work out of where to download software and how to get it installed.  
* [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) - sync directories and files between machines.  Can either sync all or selectively sync file.    
* [Greenshot](http://getgreenshot.org) - free utility to take and edit screenshots.  has a basic built-in editor, can copy to clipboard or open an office product (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, outlook) if installed.  
* [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net) - Forget about the start menu.  Launch programs with a few keystrokes.  Setup shortcuts for common web sites you use. 
* [Linqpad](http://linqpad.net) - Scratchpad for .NET.  Rich formatted output.  Intellisense.  If you are a .NET program this is a much have application.  Well worth the small amount of money to get the license to use the Intellisense.
* [LastPass](http://lastpass.com) - Password Manager.  Remembers passwords so you don't have to.  Auto log you into web sites, store secure notes, wifi passwords, etc.  Web interface and desktop is free.  Mobile device application is premium version at $12 per year.
* [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) - Save web pages/articles for later and view when ready including offline.  Way better than keeping a ton of bookmarks around that you never get back to.  
* [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) - Easily create lightweight and reproducible virtual machines.  If you are using virtual machines on your Windows machine, let Vagrant manage the configurations of it.  No longer will it only work on your machine.  I have a blog series on using Vagrant and Chocolatey together at [http://digitaldrummerj.me/vagrant-overview/](http://digitaldrummerj.me/vagrant-overview/)  
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - great all around text editor and development environment.  Focused on code first.
