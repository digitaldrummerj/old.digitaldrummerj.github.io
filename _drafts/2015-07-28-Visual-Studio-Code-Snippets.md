There are a bunch of built-in Visual Studio code snippets that will generate code for you with a short keyword and then a tab key.  These shortcuts make it less painful to create mundane code such as creating a bunch of auto properties, loops, exceptions, etc.

###Loops

* do
* while
* for
* foreach

###Conditionals

* if
* else
* switch

###Error Trapping

* try
* tryf
* exception

###Properties

* prop
* propfull
* propg

###Misc

* ctor
* enum
* struct
* #region
