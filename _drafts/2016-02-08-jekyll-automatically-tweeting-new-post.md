Welcome to the continuing series on using Jekyll.  In this tutorial you will learn how to automatically send out a tweet when a new blog post is published.

One way to help gain readership and get free advertising is to tweet out when new blog post is published.   For my RSS feed I use Feedburner so it takes a bit before a new blog post shows up in the feed.  This I have to wait to send out the tweet and not forget about it.  To get around this issue I use [Zapier](http://zapier.com) to monitor the RSS  feed and submit a tweet to the top of my [Buffer](http://buffer.com)  list.  

I could have also used [IFTTT ](http://ifttt.com)  but they do not have the ability to submit to the top of the Buffer list, so instead I would either have to have my post wait in the buffer list along with everything else I am retweeting or would have to immediately send it to Twitter.   This wasn't the desired functionality that I wanted.

If you haven't heard of either of these systems before they both work pretty much the same way.   They monitor something and then take action when it changes.  They both have hundreds of task that you can automate against  a variety of different systems like Trello, Github, Google Sheet, etc.

You will need an account in order to use these systems.  Both of them are free but Zapier limits the number of automated task (10 tasks) and the number of times it can run reach month (100 times).

Both systems work extremely well and for additional tasks it is just a matter of which system has the ability to interact with your other systems.

 The one feature that Zapier has that I like better is the ability to use Buffer and tell it to put the tweet at the top of the queue.  I like to use Buffer so that I can send out tweets at specific times instead of immediately.
