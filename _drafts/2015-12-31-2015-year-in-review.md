At the beginning of 2015 I had set a few goals for myself: 

1. Speak at more events 
2. Start blogging again
3. Be more active in my local dev commcommunity

Overall, I was successful and it was a great year.  

## Speaking 
I spoke at a good amount of events this year considering this was my first year print myself out there.  

* User Groups / Meetups
* Conferences
* Code Camps 

## Blogging 

I had tried blogging in the past and it never lasted more than a few post.  Well, not this time.  In January, I created [http://digitaldrummerj.me ](http://digitaldrummerj.me ) using Jekyll and hosting it on Github Pages.  

This year I wrote 50 posts with 54,000 page views.  

I had a lot of fun using Jekyll and creating the layout for my blog.  I could have easily went with WordPress or one of the canned solutions but I took it as an opportunity to sharpen my html and css skills as well as learn some new things like using Google Analytics and Disqus.  

I even redid the theme for the blog in the middle of the year which was an adventure in itself.  I don't plan on doing this very often as it took a lot of time away from writing blog post.  I  much happier though with the new theme, so the time was at least worth it. 

I also figured out how to use Zapier to create a scheduling engine for the blog using Google Calendar and Github Pull Request.  Essentially I commit on a branch with a certain commit message, Zapier then creates a Google calendar meeting  and then at the meeting time it does an auto merge pull request to publish the post.  

For my first year blogging I consider this a success.  I have done very little marketing for the blog.  My main marketing has been to tweet new post and to include the links to my presentations on the speaking page.  As well I did post comment to various places when I saw a question that I had a blog post that solved it. 

My goals for the blog next year:

* Double the number of post
* Stick to the calendar of post in Trello
* Write every day even if it is just 10 minutes
* Submit  to be a guest blogger on at least one popular blog

## Dev Community
