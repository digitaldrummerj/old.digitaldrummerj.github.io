2015 was a great year with lots of new adventures.   I did a bunch of travelling, started a new position at work, competed in my first hackathon (and win), and started a couple of meetups.  At the beginning of 2015 I set a few goals for myself: 

1. Speak at more events 
2. Start blogging again
3. Be more active in my local dev community

## Speaking 

I spoke at a good amount of events this year considering this was my first year print myself out there.   I found that I really love presenting and helping other reach their ends goals.  

I presented 31 talks at 19 different events.  

* 10 User Groups / Meetups
* 5 Conferences
* 4 Code Camps 

You can see all my  presentations at [http://digitaldrummerj.me/speaking/ ](http://digitaldrummerj.me/speaking/)

My goals for speaking in 2016 are:

* Submit to more conferences.  Want to put speak at more but since it is CFP for them the selection part is out of my control.
* Complete my Pluralsight audition and hopefully a course
* Come up with at least 1 new talk

## Blogging 

I had tried blogging in the past and it never lasted more than a few post.  Well, not this time.  In January, I created [http://digitaldrummerj.me ](http://digitaldrummerj.me ) using Jekyll and hosting it on Github Pages.  

This year I wrote 50 posts with 54,000 page views.  

I had a lot of fun using Jekyll and creating the layout for my blog.  I could have easily went with WordPress or one of the canned solutions but I took it as an opportunity to sharpen my html and css skills as well as learn some new things like using Google Analytics and Disqus.  

I even redid the theme for the blog in the middle of the year which was an adventure in itself.  I don't plan on doing this very often as it took a lot of time away from writing blog post.  I  much happier though with the new theme, so the time was at least worth it. 

I also figured out how to use Zapier to create a scheduling engine for the blog using Google Calendar and Github Pull Request.  Essentially I commit on a branch with a certain commit message, Zapier then creates a Google calendar meeting  and then at the meeting time it does an auto merge pull request to publish the post.  

For my first year blogging I consider this a success.  I have done very little marketing for the blog.  My main marketing has been to tweet new post and to include the links to my presentations on the speaking page.  As well I did post comment to various places when I saw a question that I had a blog post that solved it. 

My goals for the blog next year:

* Double the number of post
* Stick to the calendar of post in Trello
* Write every day even if it is just 10 minutes
* Submit  to be a guest blogger on at least one popular blog

## Dev Community

I had been part of various user groups over the years but was never part of the organizing committee nor did I present often at user groups.  

This year I decided to change that.  Right after I started using Jekyll and Github Pages, what is now the Phoenix Version Control meetup was started and I was asked if I wanted to be a co-organizer.  Originally it started as a Github Pages group but quickly changed to more about version control with a focus on Github.  

Then around August of this year I saw on meetup that Michael Iglesias was starting an Ionic Arizona meetup.  I had also been thinking about starting one as well, so I sent a message  to Michael offering to present at one of the meetings and asking if he needed a co-organizer.  He graciously accepted both offers.  After some searching for a venue, we held our first meeting at the end of September  with about 30 people attending.  Since then we have had 3 more meetings with 20-25 people at each meeting.  For 2016,  we already have a great set of talks for the first half of the year schedule.  In December, I  also registered [ionic-az.org](http://ionic-az.org) and decided to create a newsletter for the group.    The first newsletter went out the week of Christmas and the next one is ready and will be going out next week.  I will  be writing a blog post on how I created the newsletter using a combination of feedly, pocket, google spreadsheet, bitly, mail chimp and jekyll.  

I have also joined the planning comittee for an Agile Conference in Portland that is scheduled for April and will be helping with the planning for Desert Code Camp in Phoenix.  

I also helped out as a mentor at the Chandler Startup weekend.   Was also suppose to mentor at She Hacks AZ but that event got cancelled.  

My community goals for 2016 are:

* Continue to grow Ionic AZ  attendance.
* Grow Ionic AZ to where I do not have to present a topic at each meeting
* Continue to build my community network. 

## Wrapping up

Well this post turn out longer than I originally planned.  Guess I did a lot more in 2015 than I thought.  It was a great year and looking forward to 2016.  

To start the year I am running an Ionic Workshop on January 16th at Gangplank Chandler, will be speaking at the Javascript Summit Virtual Conference in February and  in March will be  running an Ionic workshop at O'Rielly Fluent Conf.  

If you see me out at any events, come up and say hi.
