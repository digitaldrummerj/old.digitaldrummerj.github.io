Welcome to the continuing series on using Jekyll.  In this tutorial you will learn how to automatically send out a tweet when a new blog post is published.

To help gain readership and get free advertising you should tweet out when new blog post is published.   To ensure this gets done in a timely fashion, the best thing to do is automate the posting.  There are two online systems that will do this for.  The first one is [IFTTT ](http://ifttt.com) and second one is [Zapier](http://zapier.com).  

Both of these systems work pretty much the same way.   They monitor something and then take action when it changes.  

You will need an account in order to use these systems.  Both of them are free but Zapier limits the number of automated task (10 tasks) and the number of times it can run reach month (100 times).

Both systems work extremely well and for additional tasks it is just a matter of which system has the ability to interact with your other systems.
