At the HolidayJs event I won a book and I picked a copy of Angular In Action by Lukas Ruebbelke.  I had already been using Angular for a few projects and wasn't expecting to get much out of the book.  Honestly I really got it to use as more of a give away at one of my talks but figured I would at least glance through a few chapters of it first.  Needless to say I ended up reading the whole book and plan to keep it.

This book is one of the best introduction to all of the parts of Angular that you need to get started.  Lukas does a fantastic jobs of explaining how it all works with lots of good code examples.  The book walks you through building a Trello clone with a pre-built backend so that you can stay focused on Angular and not worry about the data storage.  After reading this book and going through the code examples you will be well on your way to being able to create your own Angular application.

The book starts off explaining how all of the parts of Angular play together betweens configurations, routes, views, directives, controllers, services, and $scope.  It is one of the best explanation that I had read or seen.  Before this book I had  understood how it played together enough to be able to code with it but couldn't explain it well to others.  Not anymore.  If nothing else the opening chapter was more than worth it. 

Before diving into the details of each component, Lukas tasks about how to structure your Angular applications.  He covers the basics and some common best practices.  For detailed style guides he refers you to John Papa and Todd Moto's style guides.  I very much appreciate that he didn't rehash their style guides.  
  
Next the book dives into the details of each of the components.  He starts with views and controllers, the discusses services and then finishes off with directives.  He spends a while chapter on each component and the explanation of each is extremely easy to understand.  He walks through each of the sections as he is building the sample app which really help to reinforce the concepts.   

Then we take a trip into polishing the UI with animations.  It was well explained and cool to see it in action.  However it was the one piece of the book that felt like it didn't fit as well.  With that said, I am betting though if youy left out the animations from the sample app that you would have immediately noticed and thought the app didn't look as polished.  

After animation, he covers routing.????
Next up is a quick trip into forms and forms validation.  Again Lukas does a great job of explaining the concept.  ????

???mention testing???

Overall, I would give this book 5 out of 5 stars.  If you are already an Angular developer or just getting into Angular this is a must have book.  Wish I would have had it a long time ago.
