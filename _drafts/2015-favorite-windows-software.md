Here is my 2015 list of favorite windows software. 

* Greenshot - free utility to take and edit screenshots.  has a basic built-in editor, can copy to clipboard or open an office product (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, outlook) if installed.  
* Visual Studio Code - great all around text editor and development environment.  Focused on code first.
