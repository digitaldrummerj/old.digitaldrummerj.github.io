Welcome to my [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) workshop.  This workshop is designed to be a hands-on all day workshop.  There will be a mix of lecture to introduce concepts and then a lab to reinforce those concepts.

  By the end of this workshop you will have a completed application that stores its data in the Cloud and is ready to be deployed to devices.

> Note that the workshop can be modified to run as a half day workshop as well.

For these labs to work you need to setup your machine for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) development.  The instructions do vary depending on if you are on Windows or Mac.  Linux is supported for development but we are not going to be using it in this workshop.
