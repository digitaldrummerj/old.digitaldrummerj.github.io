I am starting to finally learn the git command line instead of just using a UI so that I can actually understand what git is really doing.

## Git Commands

### Getting code to local machine

In Git terms, this is called cloning a repository and the command to use is git clone.  

- git clone [Remote Repository Url]  
	- directory name will match repository name
- git clone [Remote Repository Url]  [Directory to Clone into]
	- use this command if you want to name the directory different than the repository name

### Where did the local repository come from?

git remote - v

### See what files have changed

Long Form: git status  
Short Form: git status -s


### Turning a directory into a repository on the local machine

run git init in the directory that you want to turn into a repository on the local machine.

### Adding files to the repository

git add [file name]

### Ignoring files

create .gitignore file 

  starter files at [https://github.com/github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
  
  ### Committing files to the local repository
  
  git commit -m "Your Message"
  
  ### Removing Files
  
  git rm [File Name]
  
  ### Moving Files
  
  git mv [Old File Name] [New File Name]
