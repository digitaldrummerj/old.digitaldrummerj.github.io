I am starting to finally learn the git command line instead of just using a UI so that I can actually understand what git is really doing.

## Git Notes

I am finally forcing myself to learn the git commands instead of just poking around using the GitHub for Windows UI.  Below are my notes on the commands.

To cache credentials use:  git config --global credential.helper cache
## Basic Commands

### Getting code to local machine

In Git terms, this is called cloning a repository and the command to use is git clone.  

- git clone [Remote Repository Url]  
	- directory name will match repository name
- git clone [Remote Repository Url]  [Directory to Clone into]
	- use this command if you want to name the directory different than the repository name

### Where did the local repository come from?

git remote - v

### See what files have changed

Long Form: git status  
Short Form: git status -s


### Turning a directory into a repository on the local machine

run git init in the directory that you want to turn into a repository on the local machine.

### Adding files to the repository

git add [file name]

### Ignoring files

create .gitignore file 

  starter files at [https://github.com/github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
  
  ### Committing files to the local repository
  
  git commit -m "Your Message"
  
  ### Removing Files
  
  git rm [File Name]
  
  ### Moving Files
  
  git mv [Old File Name] [New File Name]
  
  ### Publishing files to the remote repository
  
  git push
  
  ***
  ## Storing work that you want to keep but not commit
  
  ### Storing the work
  
  git stash
  
  ### Seeing what work is stored
  
  git stash list
  
  ### Applying the last stash to the current code
  
  git stash apply
  
  ### Applying a different stash then the last one to the current code
  
  git stash apply stash@{[Number for stash from git stash list command]}
  
***  
  ## Branching
  
  ### Creating a Branch
  
  git branch [Branch Name]
  
  ### Switch to a branch
  
  git checkout [Branch Name]
  
  ### Merging a branch into the master (HEAD)
  
  First make sure you are on the master branch: git checkout master
  
  Then issue the merge command: git merge [branch name]
  
  ### List the branches for the repository
  
  git branch
  - the * in the results indicates the branch currently checked out. 
  
  
  ### See last commit of each branch
  
  git branch -v 
  
  ### See branches already merged
  
  git branch --merged
  
  ### See branches NOT already merged
  
  git branch --no-merged
  
  ### Push branch to remote repository
  
  git push origin [branch name]
  
  ### Deleting Remote Branch
  
  git push origin --delete [branch name]
