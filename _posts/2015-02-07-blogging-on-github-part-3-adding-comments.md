**Length:** 20 minutes

### Overview

You may be thinking that commenting isn't really that important but it is a key feature for you to be able to interact with your readers.  Users want to have conversations about your blog post with you and to feel connected to you.   It is also a good way for you to learn from them as well.  

Unfortunately, out of the box Jekyll does not have this  ability.   Luckily, it is really easy to add this ability, thanks to a wonderful tool called Disqus.  Disqus is free but still full featured.

 We will go through the process of getting a Disqus account, configuring  the account,  configuring your blog and testing it all out.

### Section 1:  How to add comments

1. Open another browser window and navigate to [https://disqus.com/websites/](https://disqus.com/websites/)
2. Sign up for a free account.

### Section 2: Configuring Disqus


### Section 3: Configuring Your Blog

1. Open a web browser and navigate to your [username].github.io repository. 
2. Click on the _config.yml file to navigate to it 
3. Click on the ![github_edit_button.png](github_edit_button.png) icon to edit the file
4. Look for the text disqus: and put in your disqus name like below. 

	disqus: digitaldrummerj
	
3. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on the commit button.

###  Section 4: Testing it out 

Open up a web browser and navigate to your blog and click on the title for the blog post that we published in our last lessoson.

Scoll to the bottom of the post and you should see a section to add a comment.

That is all there is to it.  See you in the next lesson learned, where we will discuss how to make changes locally and push them up to github vs E ditto ng directly on the production site.
