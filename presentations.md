I have a passion for coding and for teaching; speaking at developer community events allows me to combine these two.  I love to share my knowledge in order to get you to your end goal quicker.  

If you'd like me to come to your event or user group, [email](mailto:digitaldrummerj@gmail.com) or [tweet](http://twitter.com/digitaldrummerj) at me.

If you've attended one of my sessions, please send me your feedback or suggestions.

If you see me at an event, please be sure to come up and say "Hi".  The best part of the events is hanging out with other developers.

### Background

I started really getting into speaking publicly in early 2014 after speaking at the [Southeast Valley .NET User Group](http://www.meetup.com/sevdnug/) in Chandler, Arizona.  I had suggested a couple of topics for future meetings that I wanted to learn about to the user group organizer, [Rob Richardson](http://www.robrich.org) and like a bullet he immediately shot back, "when would you like to present these topics?".  I wasn't quite prepared for that response but in retrospect it was the best response he could have given to me and one that I have used in the meetups that I organize.  I had been an attendee of this user group for awhile but hadn't done a presentation there in a few years.  So after thinking about it for a few minutes I thought I got nothing to lose and asked for a few months to learn the topics.

Over the next couple of months I worked on learning the ins and outs of [Nuget](http://www.nuget.org) and [Chocolatey](http://www.chocolatey.org) as well watching tips and tricks on speaking from speakers I admired like [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/) and [John Papa](http://www.johnpapa.net/).  The presentations both went amazingly well with a lot of great feedback from audience and I was immediately hooked.  Since that initial presentations I have presented well over 50 talks and counting across the United States and Europe.

### <a name="chocolatey"></a> Chocolatey - making the process of installing software on windows easy as pie

Chocolatey is a machine package manager somewhat like apt-get for Linux but built for Windows. No more searching for the install download or trying to figure out 32/64 bit or wonder what options to pick. Chocolatey takes care of doing the install for you and you can even create scripts to install multiple packages. With Chocolatey you can bring up a new development machine with minimal effort. By the end of this session you will have all of the information you need to be both a consumer and create of Chocolatey packages.Chocolatey isn't just for system administrators. It is extremely useful for both developers and end-users as well.For developers, you can quickly bring up a new machine and get all of your software installed on it with minimal effort. It is also very easy to make Chocolatey packages for your software and distribute it to your users.For end-users, no longer will they need to search for where to download your software or how to install it. Chocolatey will do all of the work for them.

### <a name="backand"></a>Designing a Restful Api in Minutes with Backand

Are you like me  and dislike having to waste time crafting an API for standard CRUD operations?  Are you a front-end developer that doesn't want to become a database expert in order to create your Restful Api?  Then worst of all after once you do finally finish crafting your API, you have to figure out how to host it and get it deployed.   This takes a lot of time away from you being able to focus on your UI and getting it out to the market. 
 
Back& can take all of this pain away and allow you to focus on your UI and not crafting your API.  Create your data model and Back& will generate the Restful Api for you.  If you already have a database, just point Back& to it and Back& will generate the Restful Api from that database.  If you also need user/password authentication, social login authentication, server side logic, or hosting, Back& has you covered here as well.  
 
In this session, we will examine the features of Back& , walk through the creation of an API, hook the API up to an AngularJS application and then deploy it to the Back& hosting.

### <a name="cloudapishootout"></a>Data Driven Restful Api Creation Made Easy Breezy


 Are you tired of writing CRUD based APIs?  Wish you could fast track your Api development so that you can focus on your UI?  Don't want to become an API/Hosting expert just to get a basic API in the Cloud?  Then this session is for you.  Creating and Hosting a Restful Api for standard CRUD operations should be an easy task and not one that slows down your applications development.   In this session, we examine the pros/cons my favorite Cloud based API providers (Firebase, Back& and Strongloop) and then we will create an API in each.  You will be able to see how with these 3 Cloud API providers how easy it is to create a full Restful Api in under 10 minutes.

### <a name="gulp"></a>Gulp for the .Net Developer

With the release of Visual Studio 2015 Gulp has become a standard part of the workflow for .Net developers.  Gulp has a lot of functionality available such as minification, injecting script tags into html, running js hint, creating source maps, generating css from sass files, plus much more.  In this session, you will learn the basics of gulp,  how it integrates into Visual Studio, and how to create your own gulpfile to automate common tasks. You will walk away with a starter gulp file to get you on your way to fully utilizing gulp.

### <a name="ionic"></a>Ionic - Revolutionizing Hybrid Mobile Application Development or Cross Platform Mobile Apps with Ionic


Are you already a web developer and want to create a mobile application?  Then come learn all about the Ionic mobile framework.  Using technologies that we already know and love with Html 5, Javascript, and CSS 3, you can easily create a mobile application that targets Android, iOS, and Windows 10 Phone.  Your application will look, feel and perform like a native application without you having to do anything special.  Ionic takes care of all of the hard work of making it look right on the mobile devices so that you can focus on your application.  After seeing the Ionic framework, you will be excited to deliver mobile applications.  We will walk through the features of Ionic, getting it setup, and then create a fully working application that is ready to release in the app store.

### <a name="nuget"></a>Nuget is easier than you think and you should be using it as both a consumer and creator of packages

Nuget is a package manager for Visual Studio that allows you to easily share assets (dll, javascript, c#, etc files) and use them in your project.  Most Visual Studio developers have consumer nuget packages but few have created and shared nuget packages.  It is amazingly easy to create and publish a nuget package.  In less than 60 minutes I will show you how move from a consumer to a creator.  You will learn how to package up dll's, source code that needs to be inserted in a project, add/change configurations, publish a package and host your own nuget feed.
