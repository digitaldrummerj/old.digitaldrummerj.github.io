I have a passion for coding and for teaching; speaking at developer community events allows me to combine these two.  I love to share my knowledge in order to get you to your end goal quicker.  

If you'd like me to come to your event or user group, [email](mailto:digitaldrummerj@gmail.com) or [tweet](http://twitter.com/digitaldrummerj) at me.

If you've attended one of my sessions, please send me your feedback or suggestions.

If you see me at an event, please be sure to come up and say "Hi".  The best part of the events is hanging out with other developers.

###Background

I started really getting into speaking publicly in early 2014 after speaking at the [Southeast Valley .NET User Group](http://www.meetup.com/sevdnug/) in Chandler, Arizona.  I had suggested a couple of topics for future meetings that I wanted to learn about to the user group organizer, [Rob Richardson](http://www.robrich.org) and like a bullet he immediately shot back, "when would you like to present these topics?".  I wasn't quite prepared for that response but in retrospect it was the best response he could have given to me.  I had been an attendee of this user group for awhile but hadn't done a presentation there in a few years.  So after thinking about it for a few minutes I thought I got nothing to lose and asked for a few months to learn the topics.

Over the next couple of months I worked on learning the ins and outs of [Nuget](http://www.nuget.org) and [Chocolatey](http://www.chocolatey.org) as well watching tips and tricks on speaking from speakers I admired like [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/) and [John Papa](http://www.johnpapa.net/).  The presentations both went amazingly well with a lot of great feedback from audience and I was immediately hooked.  Since that initial presentations I have presented well over 20 sessions and counting across the United States and Europe.

### <a name="nuget"></a>Nuget is easier than you think and you should be using it as both a consumer and creator of packages

Nuget is a package manager for Visual Studio that allows you to easily share assets (dll, javascript, c#, etc files) and use them in your project.  Most Visual Studio developers have consumer nuget packages but few have created and shared nuget packages.  It is amazingly easy to create and publish a nuget package.  In less than 60 minutes I will show you how move from a consumer to a creator.  You will learn how to package up dll's, source code that needs to be inserted in a project, add/change configurations, publish a package and host your own nuget feed.
