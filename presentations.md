I started really getting into speaking publicly in early 2014 after speaking at the [Southeast Valley .NET User Group](http://www.meetup.com/sevdnug/) in Chandler, Arizona.  I had suggested a couple of topics for future meetings that I wanted to learn about to the user group organizer, [Rob Richardson](http://www.robrich.org) and like a bullet he immediately shot back, "when would you like to present these topics?".  I wasn't quite prepared for that response but in retrospect if was the best response he could have given to me.  I had been an attendee of this user group for awhile but hadn't done a presentation there in years.  So after thinking about it for a few minutes I thought I got nothing to lose and asked for a few months to learn the topics.

Over the next couple of months I worked on learning the ins and outs of [Nuget](http://www.nuget.org) and [Chocolatey](http://www.chocolatey.org) as well watching tips and tricks on speaking from speakers I admired like [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/) and [John Papa](http://www.johnpapa.net/).  The presentations both went amazingly well with a lot of great feedback from audience and I was immediately hooked.  Since that initial presentations I have presented almost 20 sessions and counting.  I have a passion for coding and for teaching; speaking at developer community events allows me to combine these two.

 If you'd like me to come to your event or user group, you can make a request through [INETA](http://ineta.org/Speakers/SearchCommunitySpeakers.aspx?SpeakerId=3bf95988-3e54-4757-b42b-7fc1407b36e1) or contact me directly.

 If you've attended one of my sessions, please send me your feedback or suggestions.

 If you see me at an event, please be sure to come up and say "Hi".  The best part of the events is hanging out with other developers.

## <a name="chocolatey"></a> Chocolatey - making the process of installing software on windows easy as pie

Chocolatey is a machine package manager somewhat like apt-get for Linux but built for Windows. No more searching for the install download or trying to figure out 32/64 bit or wonder what options to pick. Chocolatey takes care of doing the install for you and you can even create scripts to install multiple packages. With Chocolatey you can bring up a new development machine with minimal effort. By the end of this session you will have all of the information you need to be both a consumer and create of Chocolatey packages.Chocolatey isn't just for system administrators. It is extremely useful for both developers and end-users as well.For developers, you can quickly bring up a new machine and get all of your software installed on it with minimal effort. It is also very easy to make Chocolatey packages for your software and distribute it to your users.For end-users, no longer will they need to search for where to download your software or how to install it. Chocolatey will do all of the work for them.

## <a name="ionic"></a>Ionic - Revolutionizing Hybrid Mobile Application Development

If you want to make mobile web applications that look, feel and perform like native application than you need to use the Ionic Framework. The Ionic Framework is focused on making hybrid web applications feel exactly like a native application. Ionic uses web technology that you already know and love such as Html 5, Angular JS, and CSS 3. The Ionic Framework comes out of the box with lots of well designed code and tools to quickly make beautiful and fluid apps for Android and iOS. Hybrid mobile web development will never be the same again. You will walk away from this session with everything you need to know to immediately start developing an application using Ionic and learn to love mobile development again.

## <a name="nuget">Nuget is easier than you think and you should be using it as both a consumer and creator of packages</a>


Nuget is a package manager for Visual Studio that allows you to easily share assets (dll, javascript, c#, etc files) and use them in your project.  Most Visual Studio developers have consumer nuget packages but few have created and shared nuget packages.  It is amazingly easy to create and publish a nuget package.  In less than 60 minutes I will show you how move from a consumer to a creator.  You will learn how to package up dll's, source code that needs to be inserted in a project, add/change configurations, publish a package and host your own nuget feed.

## <a name="vagrant"></a>Vagrant - Create and Configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable dev environments.
