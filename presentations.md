## <a name="chocolatey"></a> Chocolatey - making the process of installing software on windows easy as pie

Chocolatey is a machine package manager somewhat like apt-get for Linux but built for Windows. No more searching for the install download or trying to figure out 32/64 bit or wonder what options to pick. Chocolatey takes care of doing the install for you and you can even create scripts to install multiple packages. With Chocolatey you can bring up a new development machine with minimal effort. By the end of this session you will have all of the information you need to be both a consumer and create of Chocolatey packages.Chocolatey isn't just for system administrators. It is extremely useful for both developers and end-users as well.For developers, you can quickly bring up a new machine and get all of your software installed on it with minimal effort. It is also very easy to make Chocolatey packages for your software and distribute it to your users.For end-users, no longer will they need to search for where to download your software or how to install it. Chocolatey will do all of the work for them.

## <a name="ionic"></a>Ionic - Revolutionizing Hybrid Mobile Application Development

If you want to make mobile web applications that look, feel and perform like native application than you need to use the Ionic Framework. The Ionic Framework is focused on making hybrid web applications feel exactly like a native application. Ionic uses web technology that you already know and love such as Html 5, Angular JS, and CSS 3. The Ionic Framework comes out of the box with lots of well designed code and tools to quickly make beautiful and fluid apps for Android and iOS. Hybrid mobile web development will never be the same again. You will walk away from this session with everything you need to know to immediately start developing an application using Ionic and learn to love mobile development again.

## <a name="nuget">Nuget is easier than you think and you should be using it as both a consumer and creator of packages</a>


Nuget is a package manager for Visual Studio that allows you to easily share assets (dll, javascript, c#, etc files) and use them in your project.  Most Visual Studio developers have consumer nuget packages but few have created and shared nuget packages.  It is amazingly easy to create and publish a nuget package.  In less than 60 minutes I will show you how move from a consumer to a creator.  You will learn how to package up dll's, source code that needs to be inserted in a project, add/change configurations, publish a package and host your own nuget feed.

## <a name="vagrant"></a>Vagrant - Create and Configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable dev environments.

Does this ever happen to you? The configuration takes forever to remember, document and configure. You can't seem to reproduce the configuration on another developers machine? Then vagrant my friend is for you.  Vagrant will change how you work.    You will forever say goodbye to the "works on my machine" excuse for the development environment for everyone on your team.
