My name is Justin James.  I'm a programmer, agile enthusiast, and speaker.  I work in Chandler, Arizona for Intel but **this blog, its content, and opinions are my own.** I blog about technology, agile practices, code, and the web.  I'm excited about web development, community, sharing knowledge, and agile practices.

I also have a passion for teaching and  speaking at developer community events allows me to combine these two. If you'd like me to come to your event send me an [email](mailto:digitaldrummerj@gmail.com) or hit me up on [twitter]({{site.links.twitter}}). contact me directly.

If you've attended one of my sessions, please send me your feedback or suggestions.

If you see me at an event, please be sure to come up and say "Hi".  The best part of the events is hanging out with other developers.
