My name is Justin James.  I'm a programmer, agile enthusiast, and speaker. I work in Chandler, Arizona for Intel but **this blog, its content, and opinions are my own.** I blog about technology, agile practices, code, and the web.  I'm excited about web development, community, sharing knowledge, and agile practices.

## Speaking

I started really getting into speaking publicly in early 2014 after speaking at the [Southeast Valley .NET User Group](http://www.meetup.com/sevdnug/) in Chandler, Arizona.  I had suggested a couple of topics for future meetings that I wanted to learn about to the user group organizer, [Rob Richardson](http://www.robrich.org) and like a bullet he immediately shot back, "when would you like to present these topics?".  I wasn't quite prepared for that response but in retrospect if was the best response he could have given to me.  I had been an attendee of this user group for awhile but hadn't done a presentation there in years.  So after thinking about it for a few minutes I thought I got nothing to lose and asked for a few months to learn the topics.

Over the next couple of months I worked on learning the ins and outs of [Nuget](http://www.nuget.org) and [Chocolatey](http://www.chocolatey.org) as well watching tips and tricks on speaking from speakers I admired like [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/) and [John Papa](http://www.johnpapa.net/).  The presentations both went amazingly well with a lot of great feedback from audience and I was immediately hooked.  Since that initial presentations I have presented almost 20 sessions and counting.  I have a passion for coding and for teaching; speaking at developer community events allows me to combine these two.

 If you'd like me to come to your event or user group, you can make a request through [INETA](http://ineta.org/Speakers/SearchCommunitySpeakers.aspx?SpeakerId=3bf95988-3e54-4757-b42b-7fc1407b36e1) or contact me directly.

 If you've attended one of my sessions, please send me your feedback or suggestions.

 If you see me at an event, please be sure to come up and say "Hi".  The best part of the events is hanging out with other developers.
