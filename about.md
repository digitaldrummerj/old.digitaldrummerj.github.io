My name is Justin James.  I'm a programmer, agile enthusiast, and speaker. I work in Chandler, Arizona for Intel but **this blog, its content, and opinions are my own.** I blog about technology, agile practices, code, and the web.  I'm excited about web development, community, sharing knowledge, and agile practices.

## BIO

I have been using .NET since the 1.0 beta days and html when it was just text and images.
